# Flutter circular time picker

Making use of [matthewfx/sleek_circular_slider](https://github.com/matthewfx/sleek_circular_slider) and [Realank/flutter_datetime_picker](https://github.com/Realank/flutter_datetime_picker) you can create an easy to use and good looking circular 24h time picker.

Many of the packages out there don't make it easy to update the progress indicator. Luckily metthewfx made this easy so you can realise things like these.

I hope this helps anyone!
